# BraycedForUnbased

This was an inside joke where people record my interesting takes, such as not liking certain foods or weird crushes. The idea was thought of by close friend, systie during a NYE celebration (2023-2024) sleepover.

She wanted something to log my unbased takes on food, unbased meaning weird or not-the-norm or silly.

Code was created during NYE late at night and the morning on New Year's day with finishing touches added on the 2/01/2024, three days taken from concept to final product.
